- Cultured and isolated microfungi on selective media, generating high-quality specimens for downstream genomic characterization and discovery of novel species.
- Built Python and BASH based pipelines to process genomic and time-series measurements from microbial communities.
- Applied probabilistic modeling and high-dimensional statistics to identify biological patterns in large fungal genomic datasets.
- Supported comparative genomics and metagenomic analyses of biocrust-associated fungal species using reproducible, automation-ready workflows.
