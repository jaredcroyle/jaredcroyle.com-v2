- Built Python and BASH based pipelines to process 7M+ genomic and time-series measurements from microbial communities.
- Optimized Monte Carlo and simulation frameworks for evolutionary and ecological modeling, achieving ~40% faster runtime through vectorization and parallelization.
- Applied probabilistic modeling and high-dimensional statistics to identify biological patterns in large fungal genomic datasets.
- Supported comparative genomics and metagenomic analyses of biocrust-associated fungal species using reproducible, automation-ready workflows.
